## Reflection

This project was built when I first began using React. I wanted to make something simple, clean, and easy to use, and I feel that I accomplished that.

Originally, I wanted to build a 5 day weather forecast using the Open Weather Map API. I instead opted to limit the weather results to just the current weather, and implement some icons that I designed to make it more aesthetically pleasing.

One of the main challenges I ran into was general data flow. Before this project I was not sure what a promise was, and I kept running into errors because I was trying to pass props that did not exist yet. By the time I finished this project, I had learned the basics of async requests in React.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, and a significant amount of JSX and CSS. Now that I have experience with React Hooks, in the future I plan on converting all of my class components and implement Hooks instead. I believe it would also be beneficial to design something more compact and accomplish my initial idea of a 5 day weather forecast.
